# Fish-Market-Analysis
By: Gabrielle Coronel, Kyle Zemel, Uyen Tran

# Purpose
The purpose of this study is to investigate how physical characteristics of fish relate to their weight. By building a multiple linear regression model, we aim to quanitfy the relationship between fish measurements (such as lengths, height, and width) and weight, which can provide insights into fish growth patterns and morphometric relationships, informing fisheries and conservation efforts by monitoring the health and size distribution of wild or managed populations.

# Objectives
## Background
Accurate estimation of fish weight is important for fisheries management and ecological research, as it informs decisions related to feeding, harvesting, population assessment, and market value.

## Research Question
How can we predict the weight of a fish based on its physical measurements?
